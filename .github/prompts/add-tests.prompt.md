# Add Tests

Improve test coverage for the specified area:

1. **Analyze**: Find untested code paths
2. **Prioritize**: Focus on critical business logic first
3. **Write tests**: Using the project's testing conventions
4. **Use factories**: `packages/testing/factories/` for test data
5. **Use mock providers**: `packages/testing/mocks/providers.ts`
6. **Run**: `pnpm test` to verify all tests pass
7. **Check coverage**: Ensure meaningful coverage increase
